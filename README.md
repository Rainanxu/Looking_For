# Overview
The program is a quick navigation page, and you only need to enter a keyword once to get the search results for each landing page.
The program is a single-file web page that is small and easy to deploy.
This program supports a high degree of customization configuration, and users can freely decide the target page link, color scheme, background image, launch method, etc.

# Preview
The following link preview page is available:<br>
<https://rainanxu.github.io/Looking_For/><br>
<https://looking-for.buesand.com/>

# Using
This program supports direct interaction and link control.
Link examples:<br>
`file:///C://Web/Looking_For.html#mode=3&urlnumber=8&keyword=aaa`

## Advice & Tips
Configurations can be migrated using a variety of saving methods using federation.
* Migrate the configuration to a new file by saving it to a local cache and then deploying the new file to the target location.
* Save the configuration to a file and migrate the file to the new device to migrate the configuration to the new device.

The aspect ratio of the background image can be inconsistent with the target screen, and additional dynamic effects will appear when switching.

# Development

Due to browser permission restrictions, the save function requires additional operations to work properly, and the release can be completed in the following ways.

## Use the export tool
After modifying the `Code/Looking_For.html`, use the `Tools/Looking_For_Release_Maker.html` to generate the release.

The export tool checks the program code, and the rule displays a download button, otherwise the defect location is displayed.

## Manually modify the code
The code of this program is special, and all the code will be merged into a single line when saved, and part of the code will be kept in the label attributes, so some special characters need to be modified.

Modify the code according to the following principles:
* 1 The program can still run normally after removing all line breaks.
* * Try to keep the omissionable `;`.
* 2 Copy the code in the front of `/*CONFIG END*/` and the end of `<input placeholder="I" id="Looking_For_S_Save_Body" value="` and between the two, and paste it in `<input placeholder="I" id="Looking_For_S_Save_Body" value="">` `value`.
* * Replace `"` with `LF34b;`.
* * Replace `<` with `LF60b;`.
* * Replace `>` with `LF62b;`.
* * Remove all line breaks.

After this modification, the program will run normally.
